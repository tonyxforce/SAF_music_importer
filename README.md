# SAF_music_importer

A simple mp3 importer for [tizio_bello's `Stage Equipment Fornitures`](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/stage-equipment-fornitures) mod

## Usage

1) Download the required executable from the [releases page](https://github.com/tonyxforce/SAF_music_importer/releases) and put it in an empty directory
2) Run the executable and it should create two directories named `INPUT` and `OUTPUT`
3) put the mp3 or mp4 files in the `INPUT` directory
4) run the executable again and it should create the resource pack into the `OUTPUT` directory
5) copy the directory named `S.E.F_Music_Pack` into the `resourcepacks` directory of your minecraft install
6) go into the ingame resourcepack settings and install the pack, if it gives you a warning about the wrong version, ignore it
